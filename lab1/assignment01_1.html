    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>


    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

    <p>
      At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€” as long as the subjects fall into the general categories of "awesome" and "science," we'll consider them. You can find more information about our courses on our website at:

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

    <p>
      Yes, you can learn exotic dance moves at any of our parties that are held monthly. You can find more information on our website.
    </p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

    <p>
      Dr Eleanor Gaye<br>
